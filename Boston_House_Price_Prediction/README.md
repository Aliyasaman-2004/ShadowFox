# Boston House Price Prediction

This project is part of the ShadowFox AIML internship tasks. The goal is to develop a regression model to predict Boston house prices based on various attributes such as the number of rooms, crime rates, and other relevant factors.

---

## **Project Overview**
The dataset contains information about houses in Boston, including:
- Crime rate
- Number of rooms
- Distance to employment centers
- Accessibility to highways, and more.

### **Objective**
To build a regression model that predicts house prices (MEDV) accurately using the provided dataset.

## **Steps Involved**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Removed outliers using the IQR method.
   - Scaled features for better model performance.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Linear Regression.
   - Decision Tree Regressor.
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics used: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score.
   - Best Model: Gradient Boosting Regressor (provide actual results here).
